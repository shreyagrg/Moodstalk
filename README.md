# 🌿 Moodstalk

**Moodstalk** is a UI/UX concept that connects human emotion with plant-based inspiration.  
It matches your current mood to indoor plants like Snake Plant, 
Monstera, Calathea, etc. 

## 🌱 Inspiration
This project was inspired by my recent journey into the world of indoor 
plants. I began researching and collecting a few houseplants while 
decorating my home, and soon found myself deeply interested in learning 
how to care for them, from watering routines to light preferences. I 
realised how certain plants made me feel calm, joyful or motivated 
depending on my mood and space. This emotional connection with plants 
sparked the idea for Moodstalk.
